In this project, supervised learning techniques are applied and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. Data is first explored to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Several supervised learners of your choice are applied on the data to consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, the model is optimized and presented as the solution to CharityML. Finally, the chosen model is explored and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
